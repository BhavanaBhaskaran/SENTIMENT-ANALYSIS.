*DESCRIPTION*:
It focuses on analyzing textual data to classify sentiments expressed in tweets. This project involves various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including data preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming), feature extraction (TF-IDF or word embeddings), and machine learning model implementation. Using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, or deep learning approaches like LSTMs, the model will predict sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
